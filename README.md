# Student Exam Data Analysis

## Description

This project focuses on analyzing student exam data to identify key performance factors and validate hypotheses about student performance. The analysis includes a range of statistical techniques to understand the data and draw meaningful conclusions.

## Objective

Analyze students exam data to:
- Identify key performance factors.
- Validate hypotheses related to student performance.

## Approach

- **Statistical Tests:** Conducted various statistical tests to evaluate data characteristics.
- **Probability Calculations:** Calculated probabilities to understand the likelihood of different outcomes.
- **Bayes’ Theorem:** Applied Bayes’ Theorem to update probabilities based on new evidence.
- **Normality Assessment:** Checked the normality of data distributions to ensure valid statistical testing.
- **Z-Scores:** Calculated z-scores to identify and handle outliers.
- **Noise Removal:** Processed the data to remove noise and improve analysis accuracy.
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Performed hypothesis testing to validate or reject assumptions about the data.
- **Confidence Intervals:** Determined confidence intervals to estimate the reliability of statistical estimates.

## Tools

- **Python Libraries:**
  - **Numpy:** For numerical operations and calculations.
  - **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **Scikit-learn:** For statistical models and hypothesis testing.
  - **Matplotlib:** For data visualization.
  - **Seaborn:** For enhanced visualizations and statistical plotting.
